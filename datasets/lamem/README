LaMem: A Large-Scale Dataset for Image Memorability

In this package, we include the images and their memorability scores, after accounting
for false alarms. The images are available in the 'images/' folder and the memorability
scores  are available in the 'splits/' folder. In the splits folder, we provide information 
for 5 splits of the data, each consisting of the train, val and test sets (e.g., train_1.txt,
val_1.txt, and test_1.txt).

In each txt file, we provide scores in the following way:
  <image_name> <memorability_score>
where <image_name> has values like 00000001.jpg and <memorability_score> is a float
value ranging from 0 to 1.

Note that a particular image can have different scores in different splits because for
each split of the data, we use a random half of the participants to find the train and 
validation memorability scores and the other half to find the test scores i.e., both the
images and participants for each of the splits is disjoint. This setting is the same as 
that of prior work.
